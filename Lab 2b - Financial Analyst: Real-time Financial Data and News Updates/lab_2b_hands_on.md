## Use Case Description
Merdeka Financial wants to provide its team of financial analysts with real-time financial data and the ability to search for information on the internet. They create an agent and equip it with tools to retrieve company fundamentals and analyze financial performance. The agent is also equipped with tools to look up financial terms on Wikipedia.

* Search public information for details about an entity as well as recent news and analysts reports.
* Execute internal tools for retrieving financial metrics via APIs.
* Generate a report of the findings and analysis.

By automating these tasks, the company aims to accelerate research process to identify new opportunities for investment.

## üèõ Architecture  <a id="architecture"></a>
Here is the complete architecture that we will build.
<img width="900" alt="image" src="assets/banking-fra-architecture.png">


## Financial API Agent Creation and Configuration
In this section, you will develop the Financial API Agent, one of the collaborator agents which is specifically skilled at returning market data and glossary definitions. In this hands-on lab, the Financial API Agent is empowered with two tools, the **Market Data Tool** which returns stock prices and the **Glossary Tool** which leverages Wikipedia to return glossary definitions. In practice, this agent can also get access to other internal tools such as those for modeling stock behavior or forecasting stock prices; the approach to empower the agent with such tools would be the same.

1- From the watsonx Orchestrate landing page, click **Create agent** (annotated with red rectangle) to start developing a new agent, the Financial API Agent.

![wxo create agent chatUI](assets/wxo-create-agent.png) 

2- On the Create an agent page, select **Create from scratch** tile , provide a **Name** and a **Description** for the agent and click **Create** (annotated with red arrow).

Name: 
```
Financial API Agent
```

Description: 
```
Agent skilled in retrieving market data as well as glossary definitions for financial terms.
```
As explained earlier, the decription of an agent is important as it is leveraged by the agentic solution to route user messages to the right agent skilled in addressing the request.

![wxo create financial api agent](assets/wxo-create-financial-api-agent.png) 

3- On the agent configuration page, scroll down to **Toolset** section or click the shortcut (annotated with red oval). Then cick the **Add tool** button (annotated with red arrow) to bring up the window for adding tools to the agent.

![wxo agent tools](assets/wxo-agent-tools.png) 

4- On the tool options pop-up, select **Import** (annotated with red rectangle) as illustrated in the figure below. 

![wxo tool options](assets/wxo-tool-options.png) 

watsonx Orchestrate supports multiple approaches to adding tools to agents as explained in the [Adding tools to an agent](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/watson-orchestrate/current?topic=agents-adding-tools) documentation:

   - Add from catalog: The **Add from catalog** option enables you to add a tool from a rich catalog of pre-defined tools. The catalog of tools is actively being developed to make it even easier to add tools to agents.

   - Add from local instance: The **Add from local instance** option enables you to add a tool from an existing set of tools already uploaded to the local instance of watsonx Orchestrate. 

   - Import: The **Import** option enables you to import an external tool using an OpenAPI specification and selecting which operations you want to import as tools.

   - Create a new flow: The **Create a new flow** option provides you with a drag and drop tool builder interface to create a sequence of steps that utilize conditional controls and activities. 

Additionally, you can use the watsonx Orchestrate [Agentic Development Kit (ADK)](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/) to develop and upload Python and OpenAPI tools to a specific watsonx Orchestrate instance which you can then add to the agents.
watsonx Orchestrate also supports the addition of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://developer.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/) tools. If you are not familiar with it, MCP is a standard for connecting AI Agents to systems where data lives including content repositories, business tools and development environments. MCP is becoming increasingly popular as the standard for enabling agents with tools.

For purposes of the Financial API Agent, you will use the **Import** option to import an OpenAPI specification and define which operations to import as tools. You will need a **financial_api_openapi.json** file which will be provided by your instructor. 

On the *Add a new tool* pop-up, select **Import from file** tile (annonated with red rectangle).

![wxo tool import from file openapi](assets/wxo-tool-import-from-file-openapi.png) 

5- On the Import tool page, drag and drop the **financial_api_openapi.yaml** file [here](/openAPI/financial_api_openapi.yaml) and click **Next** (annotated with red arrow).

![wxo tool import openapi](assets/wxo-tool-import-openapi.png)

6- Next, select the checkboxes for the **Get stock information**, **Get stock price date**, **Get financial statements**, and **Search Wikipedia** operations and click **Done**.

![wxo tool import operations](assets/wxo-tool-import-operations.png) 

7- At this point, you will see the tools imported under the Tools subsection which means they are available for the **Financial API Agent** to use these tools in executing tasks that require retrieving market data or getting glossary information. 
![imported tools](./assets/imported-tools.png)

8- Next, scroll further down to the **Behavior** section or click the **Behavior** shortcut (annotated with red oval) and add the following Instructions to guide the agent in its reasoning and orchestration.
