# Lab 3 - Student Service Agent (Ask Tel-U)

## Use Case Description
Telkom University serves more than 34,000 students and over 1,000 faculty members. The Office of Student Services has always been very busy handling student requests and administrative tasks. In their day-to-day activities, staff members often need to access multiple applications, such as the student information system, learning management system, tuition management system, and several others. This creates significant inefficiencies, causing delays and long wait times for students.

As a leader in research and technology, the IT Department of Telkom University has taken the initiative to leverage agentic AI technology to improve service quality and reduce staff workload. In its first iteration, the team has developed an agent that can:

- Provide student information to staff members.

- Deliver academic reports to students.

- Share class schedules with students.

The agent will be interconnected with supporting applications on the backend through API connections defined by the OpenAPI specification. This implementation demonstrates how watsonx Orchestrate can be seamlessly integrated with other applications.
